### Hi there, I'm Yoann 👋

I'm a fullstack web developer based in Paris 🇫🇷.

After few years working on recruitment for tech companies, I started to learn Javascript in early 2020 and I really love discovering new technologies and possibilities.
I'm very curious about both frontend and backend environments 👨🏻‍💻.

My main stack : Reactjs, Nodejs, Nextjs, Express, Redux, Next, Gatsby, Jest, React Testing Library, MongoDB, and more...
